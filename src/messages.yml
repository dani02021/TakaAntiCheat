#Notes:
#1. Checks without "cancelMove" are move canceled immediately!
#2. %m% - mode, %player% = player, %hack% = hack, %vl% = violation.
#3. TAC supports multi commanding.
#4. CancelMove VL is different than Threshold's VL, when CancelMove VLs are reached then Threshold's VL will be added.
#5. Check if your config is written correctly: http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/.
