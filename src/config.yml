#Notes:
#1. Checks without "cancelMove" are move canceled immediately!
#2. %m% - mode, %player% = player, %hack% = hack, %vl% = violation.
#3. TAC supports multi commanding.
#4. CancelMove VL is different than Threshold's VL, when CancelMove VLs are reached then Threshold's VL will be added.
#5. Check if your config is written correctly: http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/.

#
#DO NOT CHANGE

config-version: 1.7
#
# If the tps is below the break point, all checks will be disabled

#
#VL Cleaner Time
#Per how much time, the vl cleaner will be called(seconds)
#Suggested value: 60-120
anticheat-vl-cleaner-time: 300
#
#Ghost Mode
#If enabled, ghost mode will still catch the hacking activity,
#but will not block player activity, the hacker will not notice
#that the AC is running and reporting him for hacking activity.
#This option is global, meaning it will ghost all checks, if you
#want to ghost only some checks, you should change the values there.

#Verbose mode level
#If verbose is enabled, which level will be on?
#Mode 3 -> Shows verbose per some time interval
#Mode 2 -> Shows verbose iff vl action is triggered
